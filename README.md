# üß™ QA Portfolio

Welcome to my **QA Automation & Performance Testing Portfolio**.  
This repository acts as a central hub for my testing projects, showcasing hands-on work in:

- ‚úÖ **Automation Testing** with **Selenium (Java)** and **Playwright (TypeScript)**  
- ‚úÖ **API Testing** using Postman, REST Assured, and Playwright API  
- ‚úÖ **Performance Testing** with Apache JMeter  

My goal is to demonstrate not just tool usage, but also:
- Building reusable frameworks (Page Object Model, data-driven tests)  
- CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions/Jenkins  
- Clear documentation and professional reporting (Allure, Extent, JMeter reports)

#  Learning Materials
[LinkedIn Learning Test Automation - Selenium(Java)](https://github.com/kalharijay7/test-automation-with-selenium-webdriver-for-java-2124033)

## üîπ Projects

### Selenium (Java) - Work In Progress
- [Selenium Java Framework](https://github.com/kalharijay7/nopcommerce-selenium-framework) ‚Äì UI automation of [nopcommerce demo](https://demo.nopcommerce.com/) (login, add-to-cart, checkout). Building a data-driven framework with POM from scratch.
- [Selenium Java Automation Learning](https://github.com/kalharijay7/nopcommerce-test-automation.git) - A practice/learning repo of automating end-to-end tese cases of [nopcommerce demo](https://demo.nopcommerce.com/). My goal in implementing this project is to first strengthen my skills in Selenium WebDriver and TestNG, and learn best practices, before completing the implementation of the above project. So that I can clearly understand the advantages of POM and why I need to leverage automation framework design concepts to have a scalable and maintainable framework.

### Playwright (TypeScript) - Yet to do
- [Playwright Basics](#) ‚Äì Cross-browser automation for SauceDemo  

### API Testing - Yet to do
- [API Testing Framework](#) ‚Äì REST Assured (Java) or Playwright API with sample test cases  

### Performance Testing - Yet to do
- [JMeter Performance Tests](#) ‚Äì Load and stress testing sample APIs with HTML reports
