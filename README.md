# 🧪 QA Portfolio

Welcome to my **QA Automation & Performance Testing Portfolio**.  
This repository acts as a central hub for my testing projects, showcasing hands-on work in:

- ✅ **Automation Testing** with **Selenium (Java)** and **Playwright (TypeScript)**  
- ✅ **API Testing** using Postman, REST Assured, and Playwright API  
- ✅ **Performance Testing** with Apache JMeter  

My goal is to demonstrate not just tool usage, but also:
- Building reusable frameworks (Page Object Model, data-driven tests)  
- CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions/Jenkins  
- Clear documentation and professional reporting (Allure, Extent, JMeter reports)

#  Learning Materials
[LinkedIn Learning Test Automation - Selenium(Java)](https://github.com/kalharijay7/test-automation-with-selenium-webdriver-for-java-2124033)

## 🔹 Projects

### Selenium (Java) – *Work In Progress*  
- [**Selenium Java Automation Learning**](https://github.com/kalharijay7/nopcommerce-test-automation.git)  
  A practice/learning repository for automating end-to-end test cases of [nopCommerce demo](https://demo.nopcommerce.com/).  
  The goal of this project is to strengthen my skills in **Selenium WebDriver** and **TestNG**, while learning best practices before moving on to a full-fledged framework. Through this, I aim to clearly understand the advantages of the **Page Object Model (POM)** and why automation framework design concepts are essential for building a scalable and maintainable framework.  

#### 🔑 Key Features
- **Page Object Model (POM) Framework** – clean, maintainable test structure.  
- **Reusable Utilities** – centralized WebDriver setup, actions, and config management.  
- **Organized Test Cases** – dedicated classes for mandatory fields, validations, and workflows.  
- **TestNG + Maven Integration** – parallel execution, dependency management, and CI/CD readiness.  
- **Validation Tools** – built-in link validator and test documentation (`TEST_CASES.md`).  
- **Future-Ready** – easily extendable for new modules and reporting (Allure/Extent).

### Selenium (Java) – Framework  
- [**Selenium Java Framework**](https://github.com/kalharijay7/nopcommerce-selenium-framework)  
  UI automation of [nopCommerce demo](https://demo.nopcommerce.com/) covering login, add-to-cart, and checkout flows.  
  Building a **data-driven framework** with **Page Object Model (POM)** from scratch to ensure scalability and maintainability.  

### Playwright (TypeScript) - Yet to do
- [Playwright Basics](#) – Cross-browser automation for SauceDemo  

### API Testing - Yet to do
- [API Testing Framework](#) – REST Assured (Java) or Playwright API with sample test cases  

### Performance Testing - Yet to do
- [JMeter Performance Tests](#) – Load and stress testing sample APIs with HTML reports
