# 🧪 QA Portfolio

Welcome to my **QA Automation & Performance Testing Portfolio**.  
This repository acts as a central hub for my testing projects, showcasing hands-on work in:

- ✅ **Automation Testing** with **Selenium (Java)** and **Playwright (TypeScript)**  
- ✅ **API Testing** using Postman, REST Assured, and Playwright API  
- ✅ **Performance Testing** with Apache JMeter  

My goal is to demonstrate not just tool usage, but also:
- Building reusable frameworks (Page Object Model, data-driven tests)  
- CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions/Jenkins  
- Clear documentation and professional reporting (Allure, Extent, JMeter reports)
